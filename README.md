.NET Core Generic Site crawler for education (especially for myself) purposes.

Written in Rider, on Linux.

Need to be refactored, for example, implement reactive model. An Observer/publisher pattern implementation may be worth it and code will be more clean.

This code is the clean rewrite of "web crawler", students homework for "Step" IT Academy, where i worked at 2017.
